Campfire Scene for CSE 490 J

To access the project, clone from github and open in Unity.
When editing, **use prefabs**. For organization, keep meshes and materials in their 
appropriate asset folders, and group similar objects under appropriately named empty 3D objects that act as folders.

How to watch my fly-through cinematic:
1. Open "Campfire Project V1" in Unity
2. Open the "Camera" group in the Hierarchy
3. Select the object named "Camera"
4. Open the timeline window
5. Switch to game view, and click play in the timeline!
